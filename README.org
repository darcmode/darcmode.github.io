* Hi there
My name is David, I'm a software person and this is my personal webpage.

** Blog
The blog index is [[https://arcmode.github.io/dist/blog/index.html][here]]. It's built with [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] and deployed as a [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Page]].

** My Github Profile
The =Readme.org= file of this repo is deployed as [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile][Github Profile]] and
the =html= version of it which is generated with [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] (same process as my blog) is the index
of my [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Page]].
